```

1\. Import that data into R. Run a linear regression of Price on all the available explanatory variables (i.e., Age, KM, HP, Metallic, Automatic, CC, Doors, Gears, Weight). Use the summary() function to show the regression results. (Note: R is case sensitive, so be careful with the variable names.)

```{r}
mydata = read.csv("UsedCars.csv")
```

```{r}
model1 = lm(Price~Age+KM+HP+Metallic+Automatic+CC+Doors+Gears+Weight, data=mydata)
summary(model1)
```

2.  Calculate the fitted values of the response variable, and calculate the residuals. Co-list the original y values, fitted y-hat values, and the residuals together for the first 10 observations. Check if the residuals equal y − y-hat.

```{r}
model1$fitted.values[1:10]
```

```{r}
resid(model1)[1:10]
```

```{r}
mydata$Price[1:10]
```

```{r}
mydata$Price[1:10] - model1$fitted.values[1:10]
```

3\. Re-produce the t-statistics for all b. Co-list your calculated t-statistics along with the t-statistics generated from summary() of the regression results. They should be exactly the same.\

```{r}
summary(model1)$coefficients[,1] / summary(model1)$coefficients[,2]
```

4\. Determine the critical value (or cutoff) of the t-statistic for a 𝛽𝛽 estimate to be considered as significant at 95% confidence level. You need to first determine the degree of freedom of your model (Hint: you can simply retrieve the value of df.residual from the regression result.) Then you need to find the corresponding percentile of the t distribution (with that degree of freedom). (Hint: use qt() function to find a certain percentile of a t distribution.)

```{r}
qt(0.05,1254)
```

5.  Calculate the p-value for each 𝛽𝛽̂ 𝑗𝑗 using the defining formula (Hint: use pt() function for the cdf of t distribution.) Co-list your calculated p-values along with the p-values generated from summary() of the regression results. They should be exactly the same.

Calculate the R-squared of the regression you have performed, using the defining formula 𝑹𝑹𝟐𝟐 = 𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺 𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺𝑺. Compare your calculated value with the R-squared value calculated by the routine. (Hint: you can retrieve r.squared from the summary() output.) Again, they should be the same.

```{r}
summary(model1)$r.squared
```

```{r}
library(car)
```

```{r}
vif(model1)
```

9\. Re-produce the VIF for the coefficient of Weight (which has the largest VIF value), following these two steps: i. Regress Weight on all the other independent variables, and obtain the R-squared ii. Calculate the VIF using the defining formula

```{r}
model2 = lm(Weight ~ Age+KM+HP+Metallic+Automatic+CC+Doors+Gears, data=mydata)
summary(model2)
```

```{r}
model3 = lm(Price ~ Age+KM+HP+Automatic+Gears+Weight, data=mydata)
summary(model3)
```

```{r}
summary(model1)$r.squared
```

```{r}
summary(model1)$adj.r.squared
```

```{r}
summary(model3)$r.squared
```

```{r}
summary(model3)$adj.r.squared
```

str(mydata2)
```

```{r}
model4 = lm(Price~Age+KM+HP+Automatic+Gears+Weight+Color, data=mydata2)
summary(model4)
```

```{r}
contrasts(mydata2$Color, sparse = TRUE)
```

```{r}
model5 = lm(Price~Age:KM+Age+KM+HP+Automatic+Gears+Weight, data=mydata2)
summary(model5)
```

```{r}
plot(mydata2$KM, mydata2$Price)
```

```{r}
model6 = lm(Price ~ poly(KM, 4, raw=TRUE)+Automatic, data=mydata)
summary(model6)
```

```{r}
plot(mydata2$KM, mydata2$Price)
km.grid <- seq(from=min(mydata2$KM), to=max(mydata2$KM), by=1000)
preds <- predict(model6, newdata=list(KM=km.grid, Automatic=rep(mean(mydata2$Automatic),length(km.grid))))
```
